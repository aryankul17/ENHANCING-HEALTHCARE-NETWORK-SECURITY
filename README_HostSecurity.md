# Host Security

## **Vulnerabilities in Healthcare Endpoints**
- **Unpatched medical devices** (MRI, ECG) running outdated OS.
- **Lack of endpoint security** leaves devices exposed to malware.
- **Weak access controls** allow unauthorized logins.

## **Defense Strategy**
✅ **Endpoint Protection Platforms (EPPs)** – AI-driven malware detection.  
✅ **Automated Patch Management** – Ensure devices stay up to date.  
✅ **Application Whitelisting** – Restrict unauthorized software execution.  
✅ **Least Privilege Access Control** – Limit administrative rights.  
✅ **Secure Boot & Firmware Protection** – Prevent rootkit infections.
