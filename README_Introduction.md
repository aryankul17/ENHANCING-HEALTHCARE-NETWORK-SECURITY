# Introduction

The healthcare industry faces a growing number of cyber threats due to its reliance on interconnected systems and sensitive patient data.  
Hospitals, research centers, and healthcare providers are frequent targets of **ransomware attacks, data breaches, and cyber espionage**.

This project presents a **multi-layered defense strategy** to enhance **network security, host security, and web security** in healthcare environments.  
By implementing **Zero Trust Architecture, network segmentation, intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS), and endpoint security**,  
this plan ensures **proactive threat mitigation** while maintaining regulatory compliance.

The document explores:
- **Existing security vulnerabilities** in hospital networks.
- **Threat modeling techniques** using **DREAD & STRIDE**.
- **Technical solutions** for enhancing **network and endpoint security**.
- **Implementation roadmap and cost analysis** for real-world application.
