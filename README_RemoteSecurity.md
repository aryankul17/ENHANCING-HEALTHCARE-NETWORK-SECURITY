# Remote Security

## **Risks in Work-From-Home (WFH) Access**
- **Unsecured remote connections** expose patient records.
- **Weak authentication** enables unauthorized access.
- **No device management** increases malware risk.

## **Security Strategy**
✅ **VPN Encryption** – Enforce secure tunneling for remote staff.  
✅ **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Prevent credential theft.  
✅ **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** – Secure employee endpoints.  
✅ **Geofencing & IP Restrictions** – Block logins from suspicious locations.
